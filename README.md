# Hopeful-Casino
WIP Online Arcade with Web3 features.

Developing my self-taught skills in Javascript and Solidity with a fun side project.
Started in June 2022- put on pause for final semester of college.

Hopeful Casino is set at the waiting line to face final judgement. 
After many complaints to the manager of the afterlife, Hopeful Casino was added to 
keep the deceased occupied until they were given their verdict to go to heaven or hell.
The games are all related to this heaven or hell theme.

Randomly generated assets in the games will be generated using Chainlink VRF (the main challenge of this project).
The first minigame being created is a basic Coin Flipping game, where users bet on if the coin will be Pitchforks or Halos.
Future games include rock, paper, scissors and on the long term, a Space Invaders type of game.

(Changes made between June 2022 and August 2022 not reflected as this was posted onto GitHub in October.)
